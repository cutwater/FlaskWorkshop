Introduction to Flask
=====================

`Flask`_ is a microframework for building web applications using Python
programming language written by Armin Ronacher. For Flask microframework
means that it aims to keep the core simple but extensible.
Flask doesn't make decisions for you, such as what database to use.

By default, Flask does not include a database abstraction layer,
form validation or anything else where different libraries already
exist that can handle that.

Instead, Flask supports extensions to add such functionality
to your application as if it was implemented in Flask itself.
Numerous extensions provide database integration, form validation,
upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and more.
