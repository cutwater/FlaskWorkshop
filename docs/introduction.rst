Introduction
============

We have good news for you. Programming is not as hard as it seems to be and we
want to show you how fun and informative it can be.

The tutorial will not magically turn you to a programmer. If you want to be
good at it, you will have to spend  months or even years learning and
practicing. Our goal is to show you that programming or creating web
applications is not too complicated in general.

We will try to explain different bits and pieces as well as we can, so you will
not feel intimidated by technology.


What will you learn during the tutorial?
----------------------------------------

When you finish this tutorial, you will have a simple and working "TODO" web
application. You will learn how to make it available in the Internet, so you
will be able to share your work with your friends and family.
