**Git** is a widely used `source code management system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control_system>`_
for `software development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development>`_.

**Git** was initially designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers
(including Linus Torvalds) for Linux kernel development.

Windows
-------

You can download and install Git from the official web-cite `<https://git-scm.com/>`_

*"Run Git and associated Unix tools from the Windows command-line"* (the bottom option).
Other than that, the defaults are fine. Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style
line endings is good.
